Project Phase 2:

The Problem:
Raw CloudTrail logs have basic fields. ML models need meaningful patterns.
The Solution:
Transform raw data into features that capture security-relevant behavior patterns.
Interview Gold 🎯

"Feature engineering was the most critical part of my pipeline. Raw CloudTrail logs just tell you what happened — my engineered features capture behavioral patterns like 'how many events did this user generate in the last hour?' or 'is this IP address appearing for the first time?' These patterns are what the anomaly detection model actually learns from."


Understanding ETL
E - Extract: Read raw CloudTrail JSON from source
T - Transform: Parse, clean, engineer features
L - Load: Save processed data to destination (CSV/S3)

Why Isolation Forest?
The Problem:
Security attacks are rare and constantly evolving. We can't train on "known attacks" because new attacks appear daily.
The Solution:
Isolation Forest learns what "normal" looks like and flags anything that doesn't fit — without needing labeled attack data.
How It Works (Simple Explanation):
Imagine you're playing "20 questions" to identify a specific data point:

Normal points are clustered together → need MANY questions to isolate
Anomalies are far from others → need FEW questions to isolate

The algorithm builds random decision trees and measures how quickly each point gets isolated. Points that isolate quickly = anomalies.
Interview Gold 🎯

"I chose Isolation Forest because it's an unsupervised algorithm designed specifically for anomaly detection. Unlike supervised methods that need labeled attack data, Isolation Forest learns the structure of normal behavior and flags deviations. It works by randomly partitioning data — anomalies are isolated in fewer partitions because they're different from the majority. This is perfect for security because new attack patterns emerge constantly, and we can't rely on having labeled examples of every threat type."
